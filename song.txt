Birds flying high, you know how I feel.
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel.
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel.
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me,
And I'm feeling good.

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel.
River running free, you know how I feel.
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel.
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good.
